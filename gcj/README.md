This directory contains solutions for Google Code Jam. All solutions are accepted by the judge. The solutions here include some that can't be found on the Code Jam website either because I improved on the solution after the contest or I wasn't participating in the respective round at all.

"Round 0" is the qualification round. Round "F" is the final. This convention makes the rounds sort in chronological orer.

Since the introduction of the new interface that requires you to submit your code (and thus you can't "bring your own language") I used Python for most solutions since it acts as a workable substitute for `q`.
